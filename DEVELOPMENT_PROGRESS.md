# Mystic Grove

First, I download the template from [Fabric mod template](https://fabricmc.net/develop/template/)
Then, I create a new repository on GitHub and push the template to the repository.
After that, I clone the repository to my local machine and open it in IntelliJ IDEA.

I clean all necessary data from the template and start to create the mod.
